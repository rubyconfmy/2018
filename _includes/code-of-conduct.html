      <p>
        The Ruby community has a strong legacy of being respectful and nice (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto" target="_blank">MINASWAN</a>).
        As part of this global community and as responsible individuals in general, we expect all attendees to respect each other, and themselves, during all events organized by RubyConf MY.
      </p>
      <p>
        The RubyConf MY team pledges to provide a safe, welcoming and harassment-free environment for all participants.
        By participating in our events, all attendees (audience, speakers, sponsors, organizing partners, staff, volunteers, etc) must agree and adhere to the conference Code of Conduct at all times.
      </p>
      <p>
        We stand strongly against any and all sorts of abusive and harassing behaviour, be it physical, verbal or emotional.
        We will not hesitate to take action against anyone found guilty of such acts.
      </p>
      <p>
        We expect full cooperation from everybody participating in our events.
        Do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:abuse@rubyconf.my" target="_blank">abuse@rubyconf.my</a> or get in touch with our ground staff should you experience or witness any harassment over the course of this event.
      </p>
